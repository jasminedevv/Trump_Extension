  "Jose Hernandez-Rebollar invented the Acceleglove, a glove that can translate sign language into speech. According the Smithsonian, \"by using sensors attached to the glove and the arm, this prototype device can currently translate the alphabet and over 300 words in American Sign Language (ASL) into both English and Spanish.\"",
  "Coral reefs are as important to marine wildlife as rainforests are to land-based wildlife. Rising seawater temperatures threaten their survival. The world lost about 16% of all coral reefs in 1998, the second hottest year on record.",
  // "Rain forest destruction contributes to climate change. That's because trees store carbon dioxide as they grow. Clearing and burning forests releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.",
  // "The United States releases more carbon dioxide than any other country, though it is home to just five percent of the world's population. If everyone in the world lived the way people do in the U.S., it would take five Earths to provide enough resources for everyone!",

  // "In general, the greenhouse effect is a good thing. Without greenhouse gases, the temperature on Earth would be too cold to support life. With too many, it would heat up beyond survivable levels. Earth is sometimes called the Goldilocks Planet because it is \"just right.\"",

  // "Mexico’s flag is made up of three vertical stripes. The left green stripe stands for hope, the middle white stripe represents purity, and the right red stripe represents the blood of the Mexican people. The picture of an eagle eating a snake is based on an Aztec legend."
